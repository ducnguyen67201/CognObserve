# Issue #118: Integrate Doppler for Centralized Secret Management

## Ticket Details

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Type** | Story |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Epic** | Infrastructure & DevOps |
| **Sprint** | Backlog (Ready for Refinement) |
| **Story Points** | 8 |
| **Labels** | `security`, `devops`, `infrastructure`, `secrets` |

---

## Summary

As a **developer**, I want to **use Doppler for centralized secret management** so that **secrets are never stored in .env files, are easily rotated, and synchronized across all services**.

---

## Description

### Background

Currently, CognObserve uses `.env` files for secret management which presents security and operational challenges:
- Secrets stored in plaintext locally
- Manual synchronization across developer machines
- No audit trail for secret access
- Risk of accidental commit to version control
- Difficult to rotate secrets across services

### Architecture

```
SDK → [Ingest (Go)] → [Temporal] → [Worker (TS)] → [Web API] → PostgreSQL
                                                       ↑
                                                 [Web (Next.js)]
```

**Services:**
- **Web (Next.js)**: Dashboard, API (authoritative for mutations)
- **Ingest (Go)**: High-throughput trace ingestion, starts Temporal workflows
- **Worker (Temporal)**: Temporal worker with READ-ONLY activities

### Solution

Integrate [Doppler](https://dashboard.doppler.com/) as the single source of truth for all environment variables and secrets across the monorepo (Web, Ingest, Worker services).

### Technical Specification

Full engineering spec: `docs/specs/issue-104-doppler-secret-management.md`

```
# Database
DATABASE_URL

# Auth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID, AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET
AUTH_GITHUB_ID, AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET

# Cross-service

### Doppler CLI Installation

```bash
# macOS
brew install dopplerhq/cli/doppler

# Linux
curl -sLf https://cli.doppler.com/install.sh | sh

# Windows
scoop install doppler
```

### Quick Start After Implementation

```bash
# One-time setup
doppler login
doppler setup --no-interactive

# Start infrastructure
make docker-up  # PostgreSQL + Temporal

# Daily development
pnpm dev  # All services with secrets

# Temporal UI
open http://localhost:8088
```

### Dependencies

- Doppler Team/Enterprise plan for audit logging
- GitHub Actions access to add secrets
- Access to production infrastructure for service tokens

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Doppler service outage | High | CLI caches secrets locally; fallback passphrase configured |
| Developer onboarding friction | Medium | Clear documentation; automated setup via `doppler.yaml` |
| Secret leakage during migration | High | Never commit secrets; use secure channels for migration |
| Temporal connectivity issues | Medium | TEMPORAL_* secrets properly configured in all environments |

---

## Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)

- Dynamic secret rotation automation
- Doppler webhooks for secret change notifications
- OIDC authentication (use service tokens initially)
- Kubernetes Operator integration

---

## Related Issues

- Depends on: None
- Blocks: Production deployment automation
- Related: Alert System (uses Temporal workflows)

## Sprint Planning Notes

### Recommended Sprint Breakdown

**Sprint 1 (4 points):**
- Subtasks 118.1 - 118.10 (Setup + Code Integration)
- Deliverable: Local development works with Doppler

**Sprint 2 (4 points):**
- Subtasks 118.11 - 118.18 (CI/CD + Docker + Docs)
- Deliverable: Full pipeline with Doppler, production-ready

### Team Capacity

- 1 developer: 3-4 days estimated
- Requires DevOps access for GitHub secrets and production tokens

### Blockers to Address Before Sprint

1. Confirm Doppler plan (Team vs Enterprise)
2. Get Doppler workspace admin access
3. Coordinate production access with DevOps team
